This loan consists of USD 50 million from the China Co-financing Fund for Latin America and the Caribbean (CHC), USD 147 million loan from the IDB itself, and the mobilization of USD 180 million in resources from other investors, including KfW DEG, a German financial institution and subsidiary of KfW; and Proparco, a French development finance institution. The IDB Invest portion had a 15 year maturity period, though the CHC loan borrowing terms are unknown.The IDB approval date for this loan financing was May 1, 2018, and it refers to this project with code 12177-01 and name 'Posorja Port.' The total investment of the first phase was estimated at USD 538 million as of April 26, 2019. The total cost of the project is expected to be USD 1.2 billion USD. The Guayaquil Port Authority (APG) helped with implementation of the project, and China Harbor Engineering Company (CHEC) was one of the major project contractors. This deepwater port is a public private partnership (PPP) project, for which DP World Posorja received a 50 year concessionaire contract in May 2016. The port is located on the Guayas River, about 65 km from Guayaquil, and is expected to have a 750,000 TEU annual capacity.Construction for Phase I of the project began in July 2017. The port began operations in August 2019, though the final part of the first phase was finished in May 2020 with the arrival of four additional cranes. This first phase included, among other things, the creation of a 20 km service road to allow access to and from the port; the development of a multi-purpose terminal with 4 Quay Cranes, 15 rubber tyred gantry (RTGs), and a 400-meter pier; and the dredging of a deepwater access channel, 33.8 kilometers long (21 nautical miles), 16.5 meters deep, and 175 meters wide. This is the first deepwater port in Ecuador, intended to allow Post Panamax type vessels to maximize their cargo capacity. The port will additionally serve Neo Panamax and Triple E Class ships. The project's second phase is expected to consist of the development of a Special Economic Zone adjacent to the port, including a 1 square km logistics and industrial park.The China Co-Financing Fund was established on 14 January 2013 with a contribution of 2 billion USD by the People's Bank of China, and it is administered by the IDB.

Then, on September 29, 2014, the Government of Myanmar issued an international tender for the development of the Kyauk Phyu Special Economic Zone (KPSEZ). On November 24, 2014, CITIC Group submitted tender documents for the Deep Sea Port (DSP) and the Industry Park (IP) Project of KPSEZ, respectively, to the Government of Myanmar. On December 30, 2015, the Government of Myanmar identify CITIC Group as the bid-winner of both the DSP Project and IP Project of KPSEZ.  On April 10, 2017, Myanmar's then President U Htin Kyaw and Chinese President Xi Jinping signed an exchange of letters regarding the implementation of the KPSEZ DSP Project and KPSEZ IP Project in KPSEZ. Then, on November 8, 2018, CITIC Group — on behalf of a larger consortium led by CITIC — and the KPSEZ Management Committee signed a $1.3 billion Framework Agreement of KPSEZ DSP Project. The Framework Agreement signing ceremony was held in Naypyidaw. [Note: In Chinese, the agreement is known as 缅甸皎漂经济特区深水港项目框架协议). According to the framework agreement, the deepwater port project was to be financed with 70% debt and 30% equity. Myanmar's Government would hold a 15% equity (ownership) stake in the project company (special purpose vehicle). Funding for Myanmar's equity contribution to the project (company) was expected come from a loan from Export-Import Bank of China.  Overall, 95% of the financing for the project was expected to come from China Eximbank, while 5% was expected to come from the Government of Myanmar (See: p. 38 of 'Myanmar Power Sector Financial Analysis and Viability Action Plan − Inception Report'). Then, on the occasion of Chinese President Xi Jinping's state visit to Myanmar on January 18, 2020, a set of transaction agreements — including the Shareholder Agreement and the Concession Agreement -- for the KPSEZ DSP Project were signed in the presence of Myanmar's State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and Chinese President Xi Jinping.  According to the agreements, the two sides agreed incorporate a Joint Venture (JV) to carry out the construction and operation of the KPSEZ DSP Project. Eight months later, on August 6, 2020, Myanmar’s Directorate of Investment and Company Administration approved the registration of the project company (joint venture/special purpose vehicle), which is known as Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone Deep Seaport Co. Ltd (ရေနက်ဆိပ်ကမ်းစီမံကိန်းဖက်စပ်ကုမ္ပဏီကို). Several months later, in November 2020, the KPSEZ Management Committee and the Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone Deep Seaport Co. Ltd — a joint venture of CITIC Myanmar Port Investment Limited  (70% equity stake) and the Government of Myanmar’s KPSEZ Management Committee (KP SEZ Management Committee) (30% equity stake) — signed a Concession Agreement. Under the terms of the Concession Agreement, Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone Deep Seaport Co. Ltd agreed to undertake the project according to a design-build-finance-operate-maintain-transfer (DBFOMT) model. A coup d'état in Myanmar began on the morning of February 1, 2021, when democratically elected members of the country's ruling party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), were deposed by the Tatmadaw—Myanmar's military—which then vested power in a military junta. Acting president Myint Swe proclaimed a year-long state of emergency and declared power had been transferred to Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Min Aung Hlaing. It declared the results of the November 2020 general election invalid and stated its intent to hold a new election at the end of the state of emergency. Then. on May 3, 2021, Myanmar’s Military Council reconstituted the KP SEZ Management Committee. The Committee was chaired by U Myint Thein, retired Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Railways. U San Shwe Maung, a member of the Rakhine State Planning and Administration Council, joined the Department of Urban and Housing Development as the vice chairman. Ministry of Economy and Commerce Ministry of Planning and Finance Kyauk Phyu District General Administration Department officials, Including officials from Myanmar Port Authority (Rakhain State). Nearly three months later, on July 29, 2021, a tender was announced to hire a company to provide legal advice to the KP SEZ Management Committee (the Government of Myanmar’s representative on the Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone Deep Seaport Co. Ltd). CITIC Myanmar Company subsequently announced that CITIC Construction and CCCC FHDI, a joint venture team, won the bid to carry out the preliminary field investigation and consultancy work required for the construction process of the project. CCCC FHDI is a subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company (CCCC). The signing ceremony of the agreement to carry out the work was held in Beijing on September 15, 2021. Then, on January 24, 2022, Daw Aye Nu Sein, a member of the Military Council, visited the Kyauk Phyu Deep Sea Port and Special Economic Zone Project site. In addition, during the meeting of the Military Council's Central Working Group on the Myanmar Economic Zone, the Chairman of the Economic Zone, Dr. Pwong San, said that the Kyauk Phyu DSP Project need to be implemented quickly because local residents would get employment opportunities and other economic benefits. In February 2022, after a year-long international public tendering and evaluation process, the consortium led by CITIC selected MSR Consortium as the Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIA) service consultant. Then, on June 29, 2022, the Central Bank of Myanmar (“CBM”) issued the Letter No. FE-1/643 for exemption of the foreign currency conversion requirements under the CBM Notification No. 12/2022 to exclude the following entities from the foreign currency conversion requirement:  Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone Project Development Company Ltd. and yaukphyu Special Economic Zone Deep Seaport Co. Ltd. The purpose of the project is to design, build, finance, operate, maintain and transfer a deep sea port facility — consisting of the Yanby lsland terminal, the Made Island terminal, a bridge connecting the two islands and an approximately 15km access road to the Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone Industrial Park — in Kyaukphyu District, Rakhine State. Once completed, the deep sea port facility is expected to allow China to gain direct access to the Indian Ocean, bypassing the congested Strait of Malacca. The deep-sea port is also expected to boost development in China's landlocked Yunnan province that borders Myanmar.  ","completion_year":0.0,"concessional":"Vague","flow_class":"OOF-like","funding_agencies":"Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank)","cofinancing_agencies":"","implementation_start_year":0.0,"receiving_agencies":"Government of Myanmar (Burma)","intent":"Mixed","implementing_agencies":"CITIC Construction Co., Ltd.

According to Moguldom Nation, the loan wielded a 25-year maturity and 5-year grace period. It is unclear whether the two sides ever signed a final financing agreement for this project. As of February 2018, the Government of Zanzibar was still negotiating with China Eximbank for this loan facility. In June 2019, the Daily News reported that Zanzibar's Minister of Infrastructure, Communication, and Transport said negotiations with China Exim Bank had stalled and therefore the Government of Tanzania would use its own funds to support this project. On the other hand, according to a 2019 report from the World Bank, construction was ongoing with financing from China Exim Bank. A November 2020 article from The Citizen suggests that Zanzibar was completely starting over on this project and a January 2021 article from the same source describes a similar multipurpose port project now being implementing with Oman. Therefore it is unclear whether a final financing agreement with China Eximbank was ever signed. In addition to $200 million of debt financing from China Eximbank, China Harbor Engineering Company (CHEC) signed an agreement pledging to provide another $30 million USD of equity financing on the condition that 13% of port shares will be lent back to CHEC after the completion of the project. CHEC signed the 36-month EPC contract on 21 February 2014. However, the project encountered various delays that had delayed implementation. The purpose of this project aims to boost trade by constructing a new harbor in the Maruhubi area of Zanzibar. The port of Zanzibar is managed, operated and developed by the Zanzibar Ports Corporation (ZPC), a parastatal organization regulated by the Zanzibar Maritime Authority (ZMA). With approximately 1.5 million passengers per year, Malindi has one of the busiest passenger terminals in the East African region. However, the port was severely congested and dated so the 2007 Zanzibar Transport Master Plan created the Zanzibar New Port Project to solve those issues. The completed port is to include 300 meters of docking space, 65 meters for land craft, modern handling equipment for up to 200,000 containers and 250,000 tons of loose cargo.","completion_year":0.0,"concessional":"Yes","flow_class":"ODA-like","funding_agencies":"Export-Import Bank of China","cofinancing_agencies":"China Harbour Engineering Co., Ltd.","implementation_start_year":0.0,"receiving_agencies":"Government of Tanzania","intent":"Development","implementing_agencies":"China Harbour Engineering Co., Ltd.|Zanzibar Ports Corporation (ZPC)","accountable_agencies":"","precision_level":"approximate location"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[39.2485549,-6.1674617]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"aiddata_tuff_project_id":57489.0,"latitude":-12.39749,"longitude":43.69665,"port_names":"Moheli Port","amount_constant_usd2021":"$167,219,059.90","commitment_Year":2015.0,"title":"China Eximbank pledges $149 million loan for Moheli Port Project","osm_link":"","umbrella":"No","financier_country":"China (People's Republic of)","status":"Pipeline: Pledge","recommended_for_aggregates":"No","recipient":"Comoros","flow_type":"Loan (excluding debt rescheduling)","description":"In March 2015 the head of China Communication Construction Company (CCCC), Zhang Baozheng, signed construction contracts for the small domestic port on the island of Mohèli with Comorian Minister of Transport, Ms. Bahiat Massoundi.

This action came roughly four years before the Chinese Government and the Government of São Tomé and Príncipe resumed diplomatic relations (on December 26, 2017). Shortly after establishing a trade mission in São Tomé and Príncipe (on November 14, 2013), the Chinese Government expressed interest in funding the construction a deep-water seaport in São Tomé and Príncipe. The estimated cost of this project was $400 million. Its purpose was to facilitate the export of oil and sea-borne commerce. Then, in October 2015, the Government of São Tomé and Príncipe (STP) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with China Harbor Engineering Company (CHEC) regarding the potential construction of the seaport as a Public-Private Partnership (PPP). The MOU specified that CHEC would first assess the feasibility of the project. Also, according to the MoU, CHEC reportedly pledged to invest at least $120 million. China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), along with Macau Legend Development Ltd, also expressed interest in the deepwater seaport project. Then, in May 2017, the Chinese Government and the Government of São Tomé and Príncipe signed a bilateral cooperation agreement, in which the Chinese Government agreed to provide $146 million of funding for infrastructure projects between 2017 and 2022 to the Government of São Tomé and Príncipe (see Project ID#71266). One of the infrastructure projects identified in the bilateral cooperation agreement was the deepwater seaport project. However, in 2018, the Chinese Government began to raise concerns about the Government of São Tomé and Príncipe’s ability to take on substantially higher level public debt to facilitate the implementation of the project. In late November 2019, the STP’s Minister of Public Works, Infrastructure and Natural Resources, Osvaldo Abreu, announced the launch of the international tender for the construction of the deepwater port in the village of Fernão Dias within Lobata district. The project described in the international tender envisages a port with a depth of 16 meters and the construction of a multipurpose terminal with a capacity of up to 30,000 tons. The Government of the STP also invited construction companies to submit proposals to build the port according o a Design, Build, Finance and Operate (DBFO) model, which suggests that this project may ultimately be financed through a special purpose vehicle (SPV).","completion_year":0.0,"concessional":"No","flow_class":"OOF-like","funding_agencies":"Unspecified Chinese Government Institution","cofinancing_agencies":"","implementation_start_year":0.0,"receiving_agencies":"Government of São Tomé & Príncipe","intent":"Mixed","implementing_agencies":"China Harbour Engineering Co., Ltd.

Under the terms of the agreement, the Chinese Government agreed to dispatch a team of 9 experts to Sierra Leone to conduct a feasibility study for a project that would involve the construction of a fishing harbor (port) in the capital city of Freetown. Then, on February 1, 2019, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Sierra Leone and the Chinese Government signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (经济技术合作协议 or ECTA), which officially committed RMB 200 million (approximately $29.8 million) of grant funding for the Fishery Harbor Project. However, in July 2021 Sierra Leone’s Parliament ratified an RMB 450 million grant agreement with the Chinese Government for the Fishery Harbor Project. The Chinese Government apparently increased the overall size of its grant commitment for the project by authorizing the use of RMB 250 million of additional grant funding for the Fishery Harbor Project that it had previously committed through an August 30, 2018 ECTA. The purpose of the project is to construct an industrial fishing harbor (port) — for tuna vessels and ‘other bigger fishing’ vessels exporting to international markets — at Black Johnson beach near a protected area called Western Area Peninsula national park. The project also involves a ‘waste-management component’ to ‘recycle marine and other wastes into useful products. Zhejiang Communications Investment Group Co., Ltd. is the contractor responsible for project implementation. Part of the land earmarked for the project is a lagoon in the dry season that opens up into a river during the rainy season. It acts as a fish breeding site, and its water flows into Whale Bay - renowned for whales, dolphins, turtles and many bird species – when it rains. Conservationists, human rights and animal welfare groups and local landowners, claim that the project would ‘destroy pristine rainforest, plunder fish stocks, pollute the marine environment and five individual ecosystems that are fish breeding grounds and support endangered bird and wildlife species.’ Two legal campaign groups, the Institute for Legal Research and Advocacy for Justice (ILRAJ) and Namati Sierra Leone, have written to the Government of Sierra Leone, under the 2013 Right to Access Information Act, demanding to see the environmental and social impact assessment studies for the project, and a government report showing that the beach was, as claimed, the most suitable place for construction ‘in terms of bathymetry, social safeguards (minimum resettlement costs) and environmental issues.’ They have also sought a copy of the grant agreement between the Chinese Government and the Government of Sierra Leone. Basita Michael, a lawyer for the ILRAJ, has said that ‘The press release was very vague. It left us wondering how did we arrive here and how come we are only hearing about this now. We have a right to know more.’ James Tonner, who owns land at Black Johnson with his mother, Jane Aspden Gbandewa, has written an open letter to the President of Sierra Leone, calling for him to intervene and stop the construction of the fishing port, which Tonner said would be ‘disastrous for the country and the planet’. In August 2021, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs made the following public remarks about the project: ‘The Sierra Leonean government and industry associations, as well as various sectors of society, have repeatedly clarified and expressed support for the project in Sierra Leone, which the parliament recently approved. The remarks of people from all walks of life in Sierra Leone clearly show that the construction of a modern fishing [harbor] has been the long-cherished wish of the Sierra Leonean people since the 1970s. The construction of the fishing [harbor] will significantly improve Sierra Leone's fishing infrastructure. On the issue of environmental assessment and land requisition, the government of Sierra Leone has pointed out that the siting of the project is the most appropriate arrangement based on considerations of multiple factors including the water depth and the environment. The Sierra Leonean side has commissioned a professional institution to conduct an environmental assessment and earmarked funds for compensation for the local landowners. According to the registration records of Sierra Leone's fishery authorities, there are now more than 100 industrial fishing vessels from 16 countries and regions operating in Sierra Leone. The completion of the fishing [harbor] will benefit not only the local people, but also the relevant enterprises operating in Sierra Leone. It is a win-win project for all parties. So the claims in this article about the fishmeal plant, destruction of surrounding rainforest, disregard for the local people, China hoovering up resources, are all untrue and untenable.’ As of January 2022, there was still no evidence that project implementation had commenced.","completion_year":0.0,"concessional":"Yes","flow_class":"ODA-like","funding_agencies":"China Ministry of Commerce","cofinancing_agencies":"","implementation_start_year":0.0,"receiving_agencies":"Government of Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation","intent":"Development","implementing_agencies":"Zhejiang Communications Construction Group Co Ltd","accountable_agencies":"","precision_level":"approximate location"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-13.16756,8.27212276]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"aiddata_tuff_project_id":38246.0,"latitude":21.49752,"longitude":91.8721,"port_names":"Sonadia Deep-Sea Port","amount_constant_usd2021":"$0.00","commitment_Year":2014.0,"title":"Cancelled- Chinese EXIM Bank and China Harbour to build port in Sonadia, Bangladesh","osm_link":"","umbrella":"No","financier_country":"China (People's Republic of)","status":"Cancelled","recommended_for_aggregates":"No","recipient":"Bangladesh","flow_type":"Vague TBD","description":"In June 2014, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh’s Office announced plans to have China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) construct the deep seaport at Sonadia as a part of China’s Maritime Silk Road.

In January 2012, the cabinet of Bangladesh approved initial plans to create the Sonadia port.  Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina visited Beijing in July 2014 and was expected to sign an MoU on the Sonadia port.  In February 2016, Bangladesh canceled the Sonadia port project.  The official reason for canceling the project was that the Sonadia port would be too close to the Japanese-funded Matarbari port.  However, the cancellation also came after Japan, the USA, and India spoke about their security concerns over China developing the port.","completion_year":0.0,"concessional":"Vague","flow_class":"OOF-like","funding_agencies":"Unspecified Chinese Government Institution","cofinancing_agencies":"","implementation_start_year":0.0,"receiving_agencies":"","intent":"Mixed","implementing_agencies":"China Harbour Engineering Co., Ltd.|China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC)","accountable_agencies":"","precision_level":"approximate location"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[91.8720995,21.4975174]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"aiddata_tuff_project_id":61126.0,"latitude":-13.82389,"longitude":-171.79659,"port_names":"Vaiusu Port","amount_constant_usd2021":"$42,632.16","commitment_Year":2017.0,"title":"Chinese Government provides RMB 250,000 grant for Vaiusu Port Project Feasibility Study","osm_link":"","umbrella":"No","financier_country":"China (People's Republic of)","status":"Completion","recommended_for_aggregates":"Yes","recipient":"Samoa","flow_type":"Grant","description":"On November 3, 2017, the Chinese Government and the Government of Samoa signed an exchange of letters, which committed RMB 250,000 of grant funding for a prefeasibility study of a proposed wharf at Vaiusu Bay. CCCC-FHDI Engineering Co., Ltd. — a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Communications Construction Co Ltd — was responsible for undertaking the study. The study was complete as of January 2018 and the Chinese Government was reportedly ‘extremely interested’ in undertake a full feasibility study. Then, in July 2019, the Chinese Government and the Government of Samoa signed an exchange of letters regarding a full feasibility study for the Vaiusu Port Project. Then, in December 2020, a Chinese embassy official told the Samoa Observer that the feasibility study was still underway and the Vaiusu Port Project was experiencing delays due to Covid-19-related border closures. Approximately five months later, Fiame Naomi Mataafa, Samoa’s incoming Prime Minister (who was before that an opposition leader), pledged to cancel the $100 million Vaiusu Port Project. She called it ‘excessive’ and noted that the Government of Samoa was already heavily indebted to China. Then, in August 2021, she confirmed that the project had been ‘shelved’. The proposed wharf in Vaiusu Bay had become a divisive issue in Samoa, playing a part in the April 20221 national election where long-serving leader Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi lost his parliamentary majority.","completion_year":2018.0,"concessional":"Yes","flow_class":"OOF-like","funding_agencies":"China Ministry of Commerce","cofinancing_agencies":"","implementation_start_year":0.0,"receiving_agencies":"Government of Samoa","intent":"Mixed","implementing_agencies":"CCCC-FHDI Engineering Co., Ltd.","accountable_agencies":"","precision_level":"approximate location"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-171.79659,-13.823894]}}]}
